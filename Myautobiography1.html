      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
       My name is Clarence T. Agnote and I'm 19years of existance. I was born on March 29, 2004, I'm from Panique, Odiongan, Romblon. I'm a 2ndYear college student that took Bachelor of Science and 
       Information Technology(BSIT) at Romblon State University(RSU). Consistency is the superpower that turns average into extraordinary. It's the foundation of success and the key to unlocking your 
       potential. Keep showing up, keep pushing forward, and watch your dreams become reality.
       I love the sea waves and the sand. the sun seems always be shining. The air smells like salt and sand. The sky looks so pretty over the 
    ocean especially during sunrise and sunsets. This place gives me mixed feelings when there, the seashore sunset is my most favorite place in nature because of it's beautiful colors, peaceful and relaxing mood, and as it reminds me of what I am thankful for in life. The ocean so 
    inconspicuous sparkles vitally looking over against the seashore.

       Panique is my hometown, and I am deeply in love with my hometown. Panique is a beautiful place. There are so many tourist spot and the people here are sincere, hardworking, simple and kind. Alaways working hard for the baranggay. Panique is a perfecture level baranggay in Romblon Province. 
       I have learned that no matter how small your hometown is it will always be the place that you call home.
      I live in my aesthetic home with my parents, and siblings. I am blessed to be protected
        by four walls and a roof, three rooms, one kitchen, and one bathroom. My house is at least 20 years old. It is my parent's hard work that has given us this blessing.
        I always imagine how my future house will be A home is a place surrounded by the people one loves.
    A house is not made beautiful by it's furniture or decor, but by the people that live inside it. My dream house should be a house that I can share with my family when I grow old.
    One of my most favorite places is the beach.

        My friends and family are very important to me, They have been with me through thick and thin. They have been there to put a smile on my face when I needed it and I know I can count on them when I need to talk or just a laugh. They always help me when I'm in need and always have my back hen I'm in trouble . I couldn't ask to have better people in my life.
        I have experienced and encountered a lot of things in school, until now. I started making memories with my classmates, teachers and friends or should I say my second family and they never failed me to have the best memories and unforgettable moments with them every year.
